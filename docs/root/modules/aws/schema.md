### ECRRepositoryImage

An ECR image may be referenced and tagged by more than one ECR Repository. To best represent this, we've created an
`ECRRepositoryImage` node as a layer of indirection between the repo and the image.

More concretely explained, we run
[`ecr.list_images()`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/API_ImageIdentifier.html), and then
store the image tag on an `ECRRepositoryImage` node and the image digest hash on a separate `ECRImage` node.

This way, more than one `ECRRepositoryImage` can reference/be connected to the same `ECRImage`.

| Field | Description |

| **backtrack\_consumed\_change\_records** | The number of change records stored for Backtrack. |
| **capacity** | The current capacity of an Aurora Serverless DB cluster. The capacity is 0 (zero) when the cluster is paused. |
