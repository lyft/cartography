#### Relationships

- GitHubUsers or GitHubOrganizations own GitHubRepositories.

    ```
    (GitHubUser)-[OWNER]->(GitHubRepository)

    ```
- GitHubRepositories have GitHubBranches
    ```
   (GitHubRepository)-[:BRANCH]->(GitHubBranch)
    ```

    ```


### Dependency::PythonLibrary

Representation of a Python library as listed in a [requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files)
or [setup.cfg](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html) file.
Within a setup.cfg file, cartography will load everything from `install_requires`, `setup_requires`, and `extras_require`.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
|**id**|The [canonicalized](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/utils/#packaging.utils.canonicalize_name) name of the library. If the library was pinned in a requirements file using the `==` operator, then `id` has the form ``{canonical name}\|{pinned_version}``.|
|name|The [canonicalized](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/utils/#packaging.utils.canonicalize_name) name of the library.|
|version|The exact version of the library. This field is only present if the library was pinned in a requirements file using the `==` operator.|

#### Relationships

- Software on Github repos can import Python libraries by optionally specifying a version number.

    ```
    (GitHubRepository)-[:REQUIRES{specifier}]->(PythonLibrary)
    ```

    - specifier: A string describing this library's version e.g. "<4.0,>=3.0" or "==1.0.2". This field is only present on the `:REQUIRES` edge if the repo's requirements file provided a version pin.

- A Python Dependency is affected by a SemgrepSCAFinding (optional)

    ```
    (:SemgrepSCAFinding)-[:AFFECTS]->(:PythonLibrary)
    ```
