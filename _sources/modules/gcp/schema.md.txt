#### Relationships

- GCPInstances are resources of GCPProjects.

    ```
    (GCPProject)-[RESOURCE]->(GCPInstance)
    ```

- GCPNetworkInterfaces are attached to GCPInstances

    ```
    (GCPInstance)-[NETWORK_INTERFACE]->(GCPNetworkInterface)
    ```

- GCP Instances may be members of one or more GCP VPCs.

    ```
    (GCPInstance)-[:MEMBER_OF_GCP_VPC]->(GCPVpc)
    ```

    Also note that this relationship is a shortcut for:

    ```
    (GCPInstance)-[:NETWORK_INTERFACE]->(:GCPNetworkInterface)-[:PART_OF_SUBNET]->(GCPSubnet)<-[:RESOURCE]-(GCPVpc)
    ```

- GCP Instances may have GCP Tags defined on them for use in [network firewall routing](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/labelling-and-grouping-your-google-cloud-platform-resources).

    ```
    (GCPInstance)-[:TAGGED]->(GCPNetworkTag)
    ```

- GCP Firewalls allow ingress to GCP instances.
    ```
    (GCPFirewall)-[:FIREWALL_INGRESS]->(GCPInstance)
    ```

    Note that this relationship is a shortcut for:
    ```
    (vpc:GCPVpc)<-[MEMBER_OF_GCP_VPC]-(GCPInstance)-[TAGGED]->(GCPNetworkTag)-[TARGET_TAG]-(GCPFirewall{direction: 'INGRESS'})<-[RESOURCE]-(vpc)
    ```

    as well as
    ```
    MATCH (fw:GCPFirewall{direction: 'INGRESS', has_target_service_accounts: False}})
    WHERE NOT (fw)-[TARGET_TAG]->(GCPNetworkTag)
    MATCH (GCPInstance)-[MEMBER_OF_GCP_VPC]->(GCPVpc)-[RESOURCE]->(fw)
    ```

### GCPNetworkTag

Representation of a Tag defined on a GCP Instance or GCP Firewall.  Tags are defined on GCP instances for use in [network firewall routing](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/labelling-and-grouping-your-google-cloud-platform-resources).

| Field       | Description                                                                                                |

| id          | GCP doesn't define a resource URI for Tags so we define this as `{instance resource URI}/tags/{tag value}` |
| tag_id      | same as `id`                                                                                               |
| value       | The actual value of the tag                                                                                |

#### Relationships

- GCP Instances can be labeled with tags.
    ```
    (GCPInstance)-[:TAGGED]->(GCPNetworkTag)
    ```

- GCP Firewalls can be labeled with tags to direct traffic to or deny traffic to labeled GCPInstances
    ```
    (GCPFirewall)-[:TARGET_TAG]->(GCPNetworkTag)
    ```

- GCPNetworkTags are defined on a VPC and only have effect on assets in that VPC

    ```
    (GCPVpc)-[DEFINED_IN]->(GCPNetworkTag)
    ```

### GCPVpc

Representation of a GCP [VPC](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/networks/).  In GCP documentation this is also known simply as a "Network" object.

#### Relationships

- Firewalls belong to VPCs

    ```
    (GCPVpc)-[RESOURCE]->(GCPFirewall)
    ```

- Firewalls define rules that allow traffic

    ```
    (GcpIpRule)-[ALLOWED_BY]->(GCPFirewall)
    ```

- Firewalls define rules that deny traffic

    ```
    (GcpIpRule)-[DENIED_BY]->(GCPFirewall)
    ```

- GCP Firewalls can be labeled with tags to direct traffic to or deny traffic to labeled GCPInstances
    ```
    (GCPFirewall)-[:TARGET_TAG]->(GCPNetworkTag)
    ```

- GCP Firewalls allow ingress to GCP instances.
    ```
    (GCPFirewall)-[:FIREWALL_INGRESS]->(GCPInstance)
    ```

    Note that this relationship is a shortcut for:
    ```
    (vpc:GCPVpc)<-[MEMBER_OF_GCP_VPC]-(GCPInstance)-[TAGGED]->(GCPNetworkTag)-[TARGET_TAG]-(GCPFirewall{direction: 'INGRESS'})<-[RESOURCE]-(vpc)

### IpRule::IpPermissionInbound::GCPIpRule

An IpPermissionInbound node is a specific type of IpRule.  It represents a generic inbound IP-based rules.  The creation of this node is currently derived from ingesting AWS [EC2 Security Group](#ec2securitygroup) rules.

| Field       | Description                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ruleid**  | `{firewall_partial_uri}/{rule_type}/{port_range}{protocol}` |
| firstseen   | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node     |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated             |
| protocol    | The protocol this rule applies to                           |
| fromport    | Lowest port in the range defined by this rule               |
| toport      | Highest port in the range defined by this rule              |

#### Relationships

- GCP Firewall rules are defined on IpRange objects.

	```
	(GCPIpRule, IpRule, IpPermissionInbound)<-[MEMBER_OF_IP_RULE)-(:IpRange)
	```

- Firewalls define rules that allow traffic

    ```
    (GcpIpRule)-[ALLOWED_BY]->(GCPFirewall)
    ```

- Firewalls define rules that deny traffic

    ```
    (GcpIpRule)-[DENIED_BY]->(GCPFirewall)
    ```

### IpRange

Representation of an IP range or subnet.

| Field       | Description                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| firstseen   | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node                  |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated                          |
| id          | CIDR notation for the IP range. E.g. "0.0.0.0/0" for the whole internet. |

#### Relationships
